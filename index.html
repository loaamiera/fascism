                According to the White House website, 
                the <span class="blue">Application of Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok</span>
                is meant to prohibit TikTok use in America until June 19th. 
                They state that the idea is 
                “to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans.”
